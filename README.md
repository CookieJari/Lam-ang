## How to use Andrew's Tilemap
### Top Soil   
There are 5 variants of soil to be used. Each variant has 3 columns and 5 rows. We have multiple variants to avoid the look of repetetiveness.
Please use different variants together when possible.

You are also given two types of grass block per variant

Labelled in the image are the columns L, M, R
L = These blocks are used on the left most part of the ground. Use this only when the block on the left is not soil and the right side is soil
M = These are the middle blocks. These are used when both sides are soil.
R = These blocks are used on the right most part of the ground. Use this only when the block on the right is not soil and the left side is not soil

### Columns

Labelled in the images are the dirt blocks to be used when making columns. Columns are used when both sides of the block are not soil.

### Corners

Here are the different types of gras that can be used on corner tiles. There are also root blocks to add a bit of greenery before reaching the grass block.

### Stalagmites

Well, self explanatory. This is used for caves.
